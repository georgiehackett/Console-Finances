# Console-Finances

## Description

In this project I will apply the javascript concepts I have learned so far. The purpose of the project is to analyse the financial records of a company.

The analysis should calculate the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.

2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

4. Track the total change in Profit/Losses from month to month and then find the average.

5. The greatest increase and decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Installation

You can install the project on your local machine by cloning or downloading the repository.

## Display

The analysis should show the following results in the console

  ```text
